# Moppy2-Arduino
Device implementation for Moppy2 for microcontrollers that support the Arduino **framework**.  Currently, the following boards are officially supported:
- **Arduino [Uno\*]** (via the Arduino IDE or PlatformIO)
- **ESP8266** (via PlatformIO)

\* Most "Arduino" boards are extremely similar and should work fine, though if you're using PlatformIO you may need to modify `platformio.ini` to match your board-type.
