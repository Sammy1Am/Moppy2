// Moppy32 was designed and tested on a generic STM32F103C8T6 board running the STM32 for Arduino bootloader
// The generic "Blue Pill" board can handle a maximum of exactly 8 drives due to only having 16 5V tolerant pins,
// excluding the usb data pins as seen in http://wiki.stm32duino.com/images/a/ae/Bluepillpinout.gif
